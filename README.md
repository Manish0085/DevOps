# 🚀 DevOps Journey

Tracking my hands-on DevOps learning using **KodeKloud labs**.

## 📌 Progress

- **Day 1 ✔️ Linux User Management**

### 🔹 Learnings
**Difference between interactive and non-interactive terminals**

An **interactive shell** allows a user to log in and execute commands,  
whereas a **non-interactive shell** is used for service accounts and prevents login for security reasons.

- Day 2 ✔️
  - **Day 2 ✔️ Linux User Management (Temporary Users)**

### 🔹 Learnings
**Creating temporary users with account expiry**

A **temporary user account** provides time-bound access by setting an  
**account expiry date**. Using `useradd -e`, the account is automatically  
disabled after the specified date, helping improve **security**,  
**access control**, and **user lifecycle management**.

- **Day 3 ✔️ Linux Security (Disable Root SSH Login)**

### 🔹 Learnings  
**Disabling direct root SSH access**

Direct SSH login as the **root user** poses a significant security risk.  
By configuring SSH to disable root login using `PermitRootLogin no`,  
administrative access is enforced through **sudo-enabled users**.  
This approach improves **system security**, reduces the **attack surface**,  
and ensures compliance with security best practices.

- # Day 4 – Linux File Permissions (Executable Scripts)

## 🔹 Learnings
**Managing executable permissions for shell scripts**

Linux scripts must have proper **read (`r`) and execute (`x`) permissions** to run successfully.  
By using `chmod 755`, executable access is granted to **all users**,  
while modification rights remain restricted to the **owner**.  
This ensures scripts are **securely executable**, prevents unauthorized changes,  
and follows **Linux security best practices** for production environments.
