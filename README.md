# 📘 DevOps Learning Log

---

## ✅ Day 1 – Linux User Management

### 🔹 Learnings  
**Interactive vs Non-Interactive Terminals**

An **interactive shell** allows users to log in and execute commands directly.  
A **non-interactive shell** is typically used by service or system accounts and does not allow login,  
which helps improve **system security** by restricting direct user access.

---

## ✅ Day 2 – Linux User Management (Temporary Users)

### 🔹 Learnings  
**Creating temporary users with account expiry**

A **temporary user account** provides time-bound access by defining an  
**account expiry date**. Using `useradd -e`, the account is automatically  
disabled after the specified date, helping improve **security**,  
**access control**, and **user lifecycle management**.

---

## ✅ Day 3 – Linux Security (Disable Root SSH Login)

### 🔹 Learnings  
**Disabling direct root SSH access**

Allowing direct SSH login as the **root user** poses a serious security risk.  
By configuring SSH with `PermitRootLogin no`, administrative access is enforced  
through **sudo-enabled users**. This reduces the **attack surface**,  
improves **system security**, and aligns with **industry security best practices**.

---

## ✅ Day 4 – Linux File Permissions (Executable Scripts)

### 🔹 Learnings  
**Managing executable permissions for shell scripts**

Linux scripts require proper **read (`r`) and execute (`x`) permissions** to run correctly.  
Using `chmod 755` grants execution access to **all users**,  
while restricting modification rights to the **owner** only.  
This ensures scripts are **securely executable**, prevents unauthorized changes,  
and follows **Linux security best practices** for production environments.
